# Python Data Structures

*DataStructures are a way to store and organize data in a way that one can effectively and easily retrieve and manage it.*

**Built-In**

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary

**User-Defined**

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Linked List
4. Tree
5. Graph

## List

*A collection of data seperated by a comma ',' and enclosed in Square Brackets '[]'.*

Eg.
```
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list2=list()
```

**Note**

1. Used to store a sequence of various types of data(ie Lists are not homogeneous and can have data of more than one datatype).
2. Lists are ordered.
3. Does not sort the Elements.
4. Can be accessed by indexing.
5. Can be nested.
6. Mutable.
7. Dynamic = Resizing of the list is possible.

**Functions**

1. append():    Add element at the end.
2. clear():     Remove all elements.
3. count()
4. insert():    Insert element at specified position.
5. pop():       Remove element at specified position.
6. remove():    Remove first element with specified value.
7. sort():      

## Tuple

*A collection of elements seperated by a comma ',' and enclosed by Paranthese '()'.*

Eg.
```
tuple1=[1,2,3,4]
tuple2=tuple()
tuple3=1,2,3,4
```

**Functions**

1. count():
2. index(): Return index of first element found with given value.

**Notes**

1. Immutable in nature.
2. Indexing is possible.
3. Faster than the list.
