**Ans.** The practise of Software Developers integrate code into a single shared repository as and when they are done working on their feature. Each integration is verified by the means of an automated build process alowing team to detect problems at an early stage.

8. Why is Continuous Integration needed?

**Ans.** It imporves Software Quality as time takes to deliver software is reduced, easy to detect and fix bugs and easier testing.

9. What is Continuous Testing?

**Ans.** The phase in DevOps which involves the process of running automated test cases as a part of an automated software delivery pipeline and get immediate feedback regarding the quality and validation of Buisness Risk associated with the Build.

10. What are 3 Important DevOps KPIs?

**Ans.** KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

    1. Reduce the average time to recover from failure.
    2. Increase Deployment Frequency.
    3. Reduce the percentage of Failed Deployments.

11. Explain the different phases in DevOps methodology.

**Ans.** DevOps has mainly 6 Phases:

    4. Deployment
    5. Operations
    6. Monitoring

12. How is DevOps different from Agile?

**Ans.** DevOps is a way to bring together the Development and Operations team while Agile is simply a Software Development methodology.

13. Continuous Deployment vs Continuous Delivery

**Ans.** 

|Continuous Deployment|Continuous Delivery|
|:---|:---|
|Automate the process of deployment to the production environment|Automation of the process to deliver the changes for Deployment|
|Completely automated|Requires some Human Intervention|

14. What can you say about the Anti-Pattern of DevOps?

20. Difference between Continuous and Automation Testing.

**Ans.** 

|Continuous Testing|Automation Testing|
|:---|:---|
|A part of delivery process where all the Test Cases are executed as a part of an automated system.|Replaces manual testing by helping developers create Test Cases that can run multiple time without manual intervention|
|Involves the Buisness risk associated with releasing softwares as early as possible|Involves developer's risk to produce a software that performs on all the user requirements.|

21. What is DevOps pipeline?

**Ans.** A set of automated tasks followed by the Engineers to efficiently Develop, Compile, Build and Deploy the software in the production environment.
