# Cryptology

1. Cryptography:	The practise and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. It means secret writing in Greek Latin.

2. Cryptanalysis:	The study of ciphertext, ciphers and cipher systems with the aim to understand how they work and to find and improve techniques to weaken and defeat them.

Cipher: A secret or disguised way of writing.

Encyption: It is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. Encryption cannot prevent interference but can deny intelligible content to a would be interceptor.

Older stories have phrases like "open sesame" which controled our ability to perceive something.

Secrets are performed in the form of keys.

## Topics

1. Encryption
2. Signatures: Hashes with a key.
3. Key Derivation
4. Hashing: Creating an irreversible representation of a value. A good hash will have minimal to no collision.

## Hash

Hashes themselves are useless. All the Hash tells us is a representation of Data. Here comes digital signatures. They are a combination of Hashes and Keys. They are extremely useful to provide authentication.

## Types Of Encryption

1. Symmetric Encryption: Only one key is used for the process of encryption and decryption.

## Types

	1. Block By Block
	2. Stream

## Example

	1. AES: Advanced Encrytpion Standard

2. Asymmetric Encryption: Uses two keys. One for the process of Encryption and other for the process for Decryption.

## Modern Apllications

	1. Secure Shell
	2. Thunderbird
	3. Messaging
	4. VPN
	5. Kindle

## How Does One Get Good Cryptography

What makes a good cryptography changes, a good cryptography obscures data in such a way that it is difficult and costly to duplicate or reserve. 

## How Cryptography Can Break

Trying to break a good cryptography is like hitting a rock with a hammer, you have to continuously hit the rock until it finally breaks, but a simple fact is that a good cryptography is like a large rock but it is also true according to the Moore's Law that hammers are getting stronger every year. It is rumoured or feared that Quantum Computer of the future will make current Cryptography obsolete.

## Future

There are certain algorithms that gaurantees security against attacks from Quantum Computer but their claims are less than substantial as they are yet not attacked by a Quantum Computer. 

Algorithm Complexity: The amount of compution power require to execute an Algorithm. A more complex algo will require more computational power.
