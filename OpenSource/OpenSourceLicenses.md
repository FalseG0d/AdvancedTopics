##### What is Copyright?

It effectively tell who has the right to make copies of the Commodity in question and distribute it further if allowed. It protects the developers legal right to control who can distribute and alter with their software.

**Advantages**

1. Derivative: Others may use our code and change it to use for a different application or testcase, thus we will be able to solve multiple problems with the same code.
2. Inviting Improvements: Making your code public allows others to make contributions to it.

**Limitations:**

1. Only your can choose the use.
2. Only you can make improvements.

##### Choosing a License?

The developer must first decide why you are writing the code for. One can make a software for the betterment of the world but the truth is that everyone is limited by their experience, another person thus can make improvements to your Software if you make it opensource.

**OpenSource is Not Free(Aways*)**

A company who has made their code public can still make money of it. What it means to make your work opensource is to make your work public, thus inviting others to contribute and improve it. 

**Use Of Opensource License**

1. Control how others can contribute to your work.
2. Control who can alter your work.
3. Establishing usage guidelines.
4. Protect your intellectual property.
5. Control how others use your code(Ensure they don't compete with your buisness).

**Opensource License Critereon**

1. License must be free to use.
2. Must allow access to source code.
3. Must allow for the creation of altered works.
4. Provide attribution to originator of work.

**Types Of Licenses**

1. Copyleft: It states that any changes that someone makes of our work must also be opensource, any improvements someones makes on our work must also be made opensource, if our project is made into a package then the package too must be opensource.
    1. Weak Copyleft: Covers Derivatives and Improvements.
    2. Strong Copyleft: Covers all three scenarios.f
2. Permissive: A little loose. The person deriving from your work can copyright their own work or atleast choose a different license atleast according to the guidelines established by the originator. They are useful when the originator wishes to be granted safety or free them from the responsibility from the use of their work.

###### How to Choose a License for Your Work?

Ask yourself the following Questions.

1. What licenses am I already using? Make sure that the packages that you use donot cause you any trouble down the line.
2. What are the terms of services where my work is hosted? Platforms like GitHub requires the developers to allow the derivification of their projects.
3. Do you want Derivatives, Additions and Distributions to use the same License? 
4. Can others use my work in their own Proprietary Software? 

**License Guidelines**

1. Use a license approved by the OSI(open source initiative).
2. Read the License before using them.
3. Donot change the license once you release it.

Eg. Facebook changed their Angular License sometime around 2017 as initially they had a clause that none of the development in Angular can be used to compete with Facebook which lead to people abandoning Angular in favor of other Libraries.
