# Open Source

Open Source is social coding. Like on Instagram or Facebook where people share their photos for others to like, share and comment. Open Source allows people to share their code and other people can view it, save it, share it, comment on it, fork the project, contribute back to the code, fix bugs and much much more. 

## Why Care About OpenSource

Many of us are actualy using many opensource projects without realizing, the only reason they are available is that there are people like us out there who contribute to them. Many may feel that they are not good enough to contribute to others work but the simple fact is that a fresh pair of eyes even adding a few extra lines in the documentation can add a lot of value into the project. This will not only improve your Documentation SKills but improve your Communication Skills, Network with Future Employers.

## Git and GitHubs

Git is by far the best source control management systems. It has additional save points allowing us to save our work before we go on, it also has the feature of branching so that we can mantain a copy of our work to prototype it. It is very efficient, very fast. It is distributed.

GitHub: It is built upon Git, providing us many powerful features by letting us use the platform via a Web Interface. We can use resources like issue tracking, project boards like Trello, integrations like GitHub actions.
