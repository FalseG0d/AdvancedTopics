# Ethereum

Before the rise of Bitcoin, all the online transactions had to be performed by intermediaries in the form of government issued and regulated currency. But now we can trade in Bitcoin a decentralized from of currency that individuals can trade directly without any help from an intermediaries. This allow us to trade using a system which virtually cannot be regulated, influenced or corrupted by the a single entity.

The Controversial Rise of Bitcoin Begs the Question What else can we Decentralize eg. Voting, Housing Registries, Social Media Etc.

Block Chain is actually a Bi-Product of the Bitcoin, it was built by fusing Cryptography, Proof Of Work and Decentralized Networks to reach to a decision without the intervention of a central authority. Block Chain didn't exist before Bitcoin. To create a decentralized network, we need a large number of inter-connected systems, Bitcoin itself works on a Turing Incomplete language which makes it understand a limited set of instruction and information. To create more complex programs we need a different language.

Ethereum is the DIY platform for DApps(Decentralized Apps), it uses the Ethereum programing language called Solidity. It's goal is to make the internet decentralized. Though internet started as being a decentralized network, it has now been controlled by large corporations in practise. Ethereum connects people directly through a powerful decentralised super computer, it is effectively a network of computers combined to form a massive decentralized computer. 

## How Ethereum Works

The programing language helps us develops smart contracts which are the logics that runs DApps. In real life a smart contract is a series of IFs and THENs(a set of conditions and actions), Eg. If one pays his landlord the Rent at the start of month then he let's him use the house similarly the Smart Contracts work on Ethereum, developers write conditions for their DApp and the Ethereum network executes it. The contracts are called "Smart" because they deal with all of the aspects of the contracts including enforcement, management, performance and payment. 

An ethereum contract is immuatble and cannot be changed unless one gets the whole network to comply, which is actually an issue as complex contract would be difficult to secure. Like any contract the more complex it is, the harder it is to enforce as complexity makes it open to interpretation.

## How it crashed down

DAO-Decentralized Autonomous Organization, it allowed user to deposit money and get returns based on the investments the DAO made, the decissions themselves would crowd based and decentralized. The DAO was able to raise $150 in ethereum currency. The code however was secure and someone was able to drain DAO out of money, the person in question was infact not a hacker but simply a patron who took advantage of the loop holes in the DAO smart contract. This lead to Ethereum Community spliting into 2 parts Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, one who stuck to the old ways while the later decided that "Code is No Longer the Law". 

## Ethereum As Currency

When Ethereum was made as a decentralized super computer, it required money to handle, manage and mantain the computers to do this Ether was invented. When a developer wishes to deploy a code, he must pay in Ether, this is to ensure that the user is not wasting resources.
