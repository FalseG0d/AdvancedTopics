# NFT-Non Fungible Token

Non-Fungble=Non Replacable
Token=The Output we get after pushing an input through the Encryption Algorithm

What the encryption algorithm does is that it converts an input into a format that is non-understandable to a third party, further there is no way to get back the original input using the output and the known function in case of a good Hash/Encrypt Function. 

### How Hash Functions Ensures Nobody Copies a Publically Available Code

The data is simply saved in the encrpted hash value. Anytime a person needs to verify that he holds the key, all he needs to do is produce the saved Hash value in front of the concerned authority and thus prove that they infact are a verified user.

### What is an NFT

An NFT is a token that was created with a Digital Asset. The token will have other basic assets too, like the ID, Prev Token ID etc. The digital asset in this case is hosted on a Decentralized Network. The question of the value is a bit philosophical, its true that you can in someway get hold of the Digital asset and should practically be able put it to use in the sameway the original owner would but in real life that is not the case. 

The feeling of insecurity, jealously or any other emotion can be at the back of our head while using it, that is the reason why people have spent millions of Dollars to truly own the asset and get the rush of power people have on owning something.

For example a single Red Pixel was sold for a million dollars, you ofcourse can use simple paint program to create a replica of the that image(The person whoo bought the red pixel won't own your pixel), you can even download the actual image from the official website hosted on the distributed network. 

### Example

For example there a hundreds if not thousands of fake celebrity social media account, though they are essentially providing the same service as the original account which if we were to stretch the legal code would be perfectly fine, still they won't get the same following as the original one.

### Why Sell NFT

To get rich, in theory this is a really good way for digital content creators to make some money as currently their industry is really strugling to support them. Another way this can be useful is to use them for earning royalties on every purchase that might take place for the asset.


### What gives NFTs their value

The value of NFTs comes from the same source that any other form of asset/currency which is people's belief. If we were to brainstorm we would realize that Paper Money, Precious Rocks and Metals, Crypto Currencies or any other mode of trade gets their value from the fact that people believe that they are desirable and can be traded when in reality even the most precious diamond is just another rock.

The more people believe in assets like NFTs the more value they will get and if at some point if enough people adopt and accept them they will actually gain more value.
