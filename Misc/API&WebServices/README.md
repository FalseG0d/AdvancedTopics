1. SOAP=Simple Object Access Protocol while REST=Representational State Transfer.
2. SOAP is a protocol while REST is an Architectural Pattern.
3. SOAP needs more bandwidth than REST thus REST is more suitable for Mobile Devices.
4. SOAP works on only XML format while REST can work on plain text, xml, html, json etc.
5. SOAP cannot use REST but REST can use SOAP.

Stateless: The server doesnot need to retain any information.

Web APIs vs Web Services vs Microservices

Microservices are an architectural style for web applications where the functionality is divided up across small web services.
APIs are frameworks through which developers can interact with web applications.

**When to use SOAP over REST?**

SOAP does retain the state thus it is advantageous to use SOAP where mulitple calls to a service are required to complete a task. SOAP is better for Enterprises level because they implement standard exchange formatsin the form of contracts.

**Caching**

Caching is the storing of data in a cache or a temporary storage area.
