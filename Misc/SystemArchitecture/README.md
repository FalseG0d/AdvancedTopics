# System Architecture

*An architect doesn't build a wall completely, they simple decide where the walls go, similarly a software architect design the structure of a complete system, they don't fill in the implementation.*

**Types of Architects**

1. Waterfall:   Design the software before a single line of code is written, doesn't/cannot capture the user's needs, doesn't allow learning. Maybe finished on time and in budget but benifits little to none, lacks flexibility, people don't follow design and add random improvisation, Slow Development. There is a single main architect.

2. Agile:       "All about welcoming change", Build very small things and release them with constant updates, inspect and adapt, invests into experimentation and throw stuff out if things don't work out, something that is looked down in the WaterFall world but it is sometims better to rebuild than build the wrong thing. Everbody is an architect at some level.
