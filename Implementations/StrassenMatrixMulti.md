# Strassen Matrix Multiplication
-Divide and Conquer Technique

*Divide a matrix of any Dimension and divide it to the Size of 2 X 2, on which the operation is considered small/constant.*

Example: If there is a 8 X 8 Matrix, we divide each of the Matrix into 4 parts and consider each of them as a seperate element.
