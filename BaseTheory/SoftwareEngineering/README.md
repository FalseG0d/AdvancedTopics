# Software Engineering

*Engineering: Application of Science, Tools and Methodologies to find Cost Effective solutions to a problem.*

*Software Engineering: A Systematic, Desciplined and Quantifiable approach for the development, operation and mantainance of Software.*

**Characterstics**

1. Software is Developed or Engineered and Not Manufactured.
2. Doesnot wear out.
3. Software is Custom Built.

**Software Crisis**

*A term earlier used to showcase the Difficulty of writing Useful and Efficient programs in required time.*

```
Causes:

1. Project got Over-Budget.
2. Project got Over-Time.
3. S/W was inefficient.
4. S/W was low quality.
5. S/W often didn't meet requirements.
```

Solution: Software Engineering

**Software Myths**

1. Management Level
    1. More Programers equals Faster Develepment: Programers have to be trained and brought upto date to project.
    2. There is a standard and procedure for developing software.
    3. There is no need to change Software Development approach.

2. Customer Level
    1. Only General Statements are Sufficient.
    2. Requiremnt changes can be easily accomodated.

3. Practitioner Level Myths
    1. Once the Program is Up and Running all the Job is Done.
    2. There is no way to assess quality before Program Run.
    3. Working Program is the only Deliverable Product.
