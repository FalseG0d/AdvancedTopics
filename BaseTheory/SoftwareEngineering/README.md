# Software Engineering

*Engineering: Application of Science, Tools and Methodologies to find Cost Effective solutions to a problem.*

*Software Engineering: A Systematic, Desciplined and Quantifiable approach for the development, operation and mantainance of Software.*

**Characterstics**

1. Software is Developed or Engineered and Not Manufactured.
2. Doesnot wear out.
3. Software is Custom Built.

**Software Crisis**

*A term earlier used to showcase the Difficulty of writing Useful and Efficient programs in required time.*

```
Causes:

1. Project got Over-Budget.
2. Project got Over-Time.
3. S/W was inefficient.
4. S/W was low quality.
5. S/W often didn't meet requirements.
```

Solution: Software Engineering

**A Layered Technology**

1. Quality Focus
    1. Degree Of Goodness
    2. Correctness
    3. Mantainability
    4. Usability
    
2. Process
    1. What To Do
    2. Delas with activities, actions and tasks
    3. Answers How To

3. Methods
    1. Deals with How To
    2. Communication
    3. Requirements and Design Model Analysis
    4. Use of Programming Tools
    5. Testing and Support

4. Tools
    1. Environment
    2. Helping Hands Of Process
    3. Automated Support
    4. Used To Code, Design, Test and Sell

**Software Myths**

1. Management Level
    1. More Programers equals Faster Develepment: Programers have to be trained and brought upto date to project.
    2. There is a standard and procedure for developing software.
    3. There is no need to change Software Development approach.

2. Customer Level
    1. Only General Statements are Sufficient.
    2. Requiremnt changes can be easily accomodated.

3. Practitioner Level Myths
    1. Once the Program is Up and Running all the Job is Done.
    2. There is no way to assess quality before Program Run.
    3. Working Program is the only Deliverable Product.

**Software**

*A software is a set of Instructions that a Computer Follows.*

*Software Deliverable: A Software along with its Documentation, required to be delivered as a Milestone set forth in the Implementation Plan.*

**Type**

1. System Software: A collection of programs written to service other programs. Eg OS.

2. Application Software: A Program designed for End-User. Eg. Email Apps, SpreadSheets.

3. Engineering & Scientific S/W: A software used to facilitate the Engineering Functions and Tasks. Eg Auto CAD.

4. Embedded Software(Combining or Adding): Resides in Read-Only memory. Used to control products and system for Consumer and Industrial Market. Eg GPS, Calculator.

5. Web Application: A client-server computer program. Client runs in a Web-Browser. Eg Web Mails.

6. Artificial Intelligence: An ML Algo developed to tell a Computer how to respond to something by Example, uses a structure as close as possible to Human Brain. Eg Speech Recognition.
