# Software Testing

It is the process of verifying and validating that a software or application is Bug Free, Meets the Technical Requirements as guided by the Design and Development and meet the User Requirements Effectively and Efficiently with handling all the Exception and Boundary Cases.

It focusses on both Finding Faults and to improve the Efficiency, Accuracy and Usability.

**Software Testing Can Be Divided Into**

1. Verification: It refers to a set of Tasks that ensures that a software correctly implements a specific function. 

"Are we building the Project Right?"

2. Validation: It refers to a set of Tasks that ensures that a software functionality is traceable to customer requirements.

"Are we building the Right Project?"

**Types of Testing**

1. Manual Testing: Testing a Software Manually, without any automation tools or scripts.

2. Automation Testing: Testing using scripts or other automation softwares. Eg Selenium

**Types of Testing Techniques**

1. Black Box: The tester doesn't have access to code.

2. White Box: THe tester has access to code.

|Black Box Testing|White Box Testing|
|:---|:---|
|Internal working of the Program is not known|Knowledge of Internal working is Known|
|Called Closed Box/Data Driven|Called Structural Testing|
|Done by Trial and Error|Can better test Internal Boundaries|

**Levels Of Testing**

1. Unit Testing: Testing each module individually.

2. Integration Testing: Combining a Bunch of Module and then Test them working together as a group.

3. System Testing: A complete system/software is Tested.

4. Acceptance Testing: Testing if the Deliverable will be acceptable to the Customer.

**Principles Of Testing**

1. All tests should meet Customer Requirements.
2. Tests must be performed by Third Parties.
3. Exhaustive Testing is not Possible but an optimal amount can be achieved.
4. All tests must be planned before.
5. Start testing with Small Parts and then extend to Larger Parts.

**Types Of Testing**

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. Regression Testing: Verifies that the recent addition to code haven't altered or destroyed the already existing functionality.
4. Smoke Testing: Done to ensure that the Current Software under testing is ready or stable for further testing.
5. Alpha Testing: An acceptance testing done before the Product Release.
6. Beta Testing: Similar to Aplha Test but Testers are closer to Client Side.
7. System Testing: 
8. Stress Testing: Unfavourable conditions are presented to the Software to check how they perform.
