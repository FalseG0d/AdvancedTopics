# Software Development Models

## Software Development Life Cycle

1. Requirement Analysis
    1. Communicate with User.
    2. Indentification of Risk.
    3. Ambiguity Problem

2. Defining Requirements
    1. Document the product requirements.
    2. Approve the Documentation.
    3. SRS = Software Requirement Specification

3. Design
    1. Product Architecture
    2. DDS = Design Document Specification
    3. Best Architecture is Selected.

4. Building/Developing
    1. Generate Code
    2. Use Compiler, Interpreter, Debugger
    3. Best suited Programming Language

5. Testing
    1. Subset of All the Phases
    2. Detect, Report, Track, Fix and Re-Test.
    3. Done till SRS quality is Met.

6. Deployment
    1. Releasing the S/W in the market.
    2. Mantain after Deployment.

## Software Development Models

*Different ways to develop a software.*

1. Water Fall Model(**Has 6 Stages**):
    1. Linear Sequential Life Cycle Model
    2. No Overlapping In Phases

**Advantages**

1. Simple and Easy
2. Easy to Manage
3. Works well For Small Projects
4. Results are Well-Documented

**Dis-Advantages**

1. High Risk and Uncertainity
2. Easy Not For Big and Complex Projects
3. Not suitable for changing Requirements
4. Can't accomodate and change

2. V-Model: Similar to Water Fall model except the Testing Phase occurs simultaneously with Development Phase.

3. Prototype Model

**Advantages**

1. Maximized Customer Involvement
2. Useful for Constantly changing requirements
3. Customer can see Steady progress

**Dis-Advantages**

1. Impossible to Know How Long process will take
2. No way to know the required number of Iterations

4. Spiral Model

*A combination of Water Fall model and Iterative Model.sdlc-sprial-model.*

*Each phase begins with Design Goals and Ends with Client Reviewing.*

**When To Use**

1. When Project is Large
2. When Releases are Frequent
3. When Risk and Cost Evaluation is Important
4. When Requirements are Unclear and Complex
5. When Changes may occur any time
6. For medium to high risk project

**Advantage**

1. Functionality can be Added Later
2. Cost Estimation is Easy
3. Lot of Space for Feedback

**Dis-Advantage**

1. Risk is Not Meeting Schedule
2. More Documentation
3. Not Suitable for Large Projects
