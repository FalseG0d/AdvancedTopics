# Programing Paradigm

Paradigm can be termed as a way/method to solve some problem. 

Programming Paradigm is an approach to solve a problem using some programming language, tool or technique available to us. A lot of programing languages are known but all of them need some strategy when implemented, this strategy is called a Paradigm.

## 1. Imperitive Programming Paradigm: 

1. It features a close relation to machine architecture(Von Neumann Architecture). 
2. It works by changing the program states through assignment statements. 
3. It performs step by step tasks by changing states.

**Advantage:** Simple to implement

**Dis-Advantage:** Less efficient and productive.

**Example:** C

*Imperative Programming Paradigm is divided into 3 categories.*

*The modern computers are built on Von-Neumann Architecture which is based on stored-program concept, that is programs and data are stored in a seperate storage unit called memory and are treated the same thus allowing us to re-program it easily.*

**1.1 Procedural Programming Paradigm**

1. Emphasizes on procedures in terms of under lying machine model.
2. More emphasis on procedure.
3. Provided re-usability of code.

**Example:** C, C++

**1.2 Object Oriented Programing**

1. The program written is a collection of classes and objects meant for communication.
2. More emphasis on Data.
3. Can handle almost all real world problems.

**Advantages:**

1. Data security
2. Inheritence
3. Code Reusability
4. Abstraction

**Example:** Java, C++, Python

|Procedure Oriented Programing|Object Oriented Programing|
|:---|:---|
|Program divided into small **functions**.|Program divided into small **objects**.|
|Top Down Approach|Bottom Up Approach|
|Adding new data is difficult|Adding new data is easy|
|Less secure|More secure|
|Overloading is not possible|Overloading possible|
|Functionality is more important|Data is more important|
|C, BASIC|C++, Java, Python|

**1.3 Parallel Processing Approach**

1. Instructions are divided among multiple processors.
2. Requires many processors but is able to run program in less time.
3. Similar to divide and conquer.

**Example:** C/C++, Java

## 2. Declarative Programing Paradigm

1. These expresses only the logic of the computation without talking about it's flow of control.
2. Considers programs as theories of logics.
3. Focus on what to do over how to do it.

**2.1 Logic Programming Paradigm**

1. Termed as abstract model of computation.
2. Can solve logical problems like Puzzles, Series etc.

**Example:** Prolog

**2.2 Functional Programming Language**

1. Has its roots in mathematics and is independent of the language.
2. Key principal is the execution of Mathematical Functions.
3. Central Model is the Functions meant for specific computation and not the Data Structures.

**Example:** JavaScript

**2.3 Database Driven  Programming Language**

1. Based on data and it's movenment.
2. Statements are defined by Data.

**Example:** SQL
